# Mincemeat 2

A modpack for Minecraft 1.20.1 that focuses on providing a challenging yet forgiving experience while also having enough content to be enjoyable for anyone.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from the Releases section on the right
2. (If you don't already have a modded Minecraft launcher) download Prism Launcher and sign in with it
3. Click Add Instance --> Import and select Mincemeat 2 0.x.x

### Optimization

4. While you wait for the mods to download, download and install GraalVM for Java 17. This is the optimal Java version for modern modded Minecraft
5. Select Mincemeat 2 --> Edit (on the right) --> Settings --> Auto-detect... --> select GraalVM
6. Set minimum and maximum memory allocation to 8192 MiB
7. Type in [these](https://gist.github.com/uthw/3648819b8acf988ed21260f62f83e05f) JVM arguments

8. Press play and hope the game doesn't crash to desktop

## Tips

-   Never update mods.
-   Don't add OptiFine.
-   Make an issue here if something isn't right.
-   Don't set allocated RAM above 10 GB.
