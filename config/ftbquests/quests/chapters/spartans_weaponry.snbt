				"In Tetra, to enchant items with books, you will need to enchant individual modules on a workbench, such as giving a handle Unbreaking. One thing to keep in mind is that if you change a module in any way, it will lose its enchantments. For example, changing an iron blade to a diamond blade will remove all enchantments from the blade module. Because of this, it is best to enchant the part of your tool you are not planning on changing."
				""
				"You can still use an enchanting table, but it will randomly place enchantments on a random module."
				"{@pagebreak}"
				""
				"With Tetra items, you will often not need to use any levels to repair them. However, if your magic capacity on a module drops below 0, it will cost levels to repair it. You can improve a module's magic capacity in a few ways, but the best method is by using Glid scrolls. These scrolls can be placed on top of a workbench, allowing you to hone magic capacity instead of an attribute like speed or damage."
				""
				"You can also upgrade these scrolls by putting them together in a crafting grid, just like repairing a tool."
