	#
	#Arguments:
	#block-ids: Multiple IDs can be used by separating them with commas (i.e: "minecraft:torch,minecraft:wall_torch")
	#temperature: The temperature of the block, in Minecraft units
	#*falloff: The block is less effective as distance increases
	#*max effect: The maximum temperature change this block can cause to a player (even with multiple blocks)

	#- (Multiple predicates can be used by separating them with commas [i.e. "lit=true,waterlogged=false"])
	#*nbt: The NBT data that the block must have for the temperature to be applied.
	#*temperature-limit: The maximum world temperature at which this block temp will be effective.
	#- (Represents the minimum temp if the block temp is negative)
